    	<p><strong>Information about Upcoming Events and Meetings</strong></p>
       	<p>The SPS Zone meeting is this week! It is a great event in which SPS members from the Pacific Northwest gather for presentations and lectures, and to have fun. It begins Friday night with a pizza mingle event, followed by a physics demo show by Stan Micklazvina and the demo room. The following morning, the SPS will meet in the Willamette Atrium for breakfast and a day full of guest lectures from UO professors and students, as well as students from other schools in the PNW. This will be a great chance to meet physics students and faculty from other schools, as well as our own, and to learn about the work they do. Scheduling information can be found <a href="Zone 17 Meeting Agenda.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
       	<p><strong>About the Society of Physics Students</strong>:</strong><br /> </p>
        
        <p>
The Society of Physics Students is a national organization aimed at creating a community of physics undergraduates across the nation. There are currently about 700 active chapters of SPS on campuses around the country, with more involvement every year. SPS is open to all students interested in physics, and includes a variety of majors including mathematics, chemistry, computer science, engineering, astronomy, and geology, among others. SPS is an organization under the American Institute of Physics (AIP), which helps fund and support SPS members. Visit the national SPS website here.</p>

              <p><strong>Past Events</strong></p>
              <p>At the week 4 SPS meeting in Spring 2013, guest Dr. Ben McMorran shared his optics research on Experiments with Free Electron Orbital States. He discussed his experimentation with creating vortex beams, and the applications they have in imaging equipment.</p>
