        <p><strong>Annika Gustafsson: President</strong></p>
        
        <p>Senior</p>

        <p>I am currently in my fourth year of a five year plan at University of Oregon. I am a physics and 

math major, and business minor. I am also a member of the Robert D. Clark Honors College. 

My research interests are in astrophysics and I would like to pursue a career working at NASA 

Ames in Mountain View, California. I am originally from Santa Cruz, California and would like 

to return to the bay area once I finish my undergraduate degree. I love research and data, but 

I also really enjoy management and outreach. I love organizing, planning, and working with 

people. I had an amazing experience working with the SPICE program this past spring and 

summer. </p>

<p>At home I have two younger sisters who I am very close with. We have all grown up doing 

sports, my sport being gymnastics. My sophomore year I walked on to the Acrobatics and 

Tumbling team here at UO and had an absolutely amazing experience traveling and winning the 

National Championship. I love sports and came to UO for physics and football. 

I also have dual citizenship in Sweden and would someday like to travel there to experience the 

culture, but also possibly do an internship or work doing astronomy or physics after graduating 

from UO before grad school. </p>

<p>So far, I have had an amazing experience at UO and I would like to share and make sure my 

fellow physics undergrads have just as amazing of an experience by exposing them to all of the 

outreach, research, and career opportunities being an undergrad at UO offers.</p>
    
        <br />
        
        <p><strong>Teiler Kwan: President</strong></p>
        <p>Senior</p>

        
        <p>I just completed my first year of Physics here, as I was a FA2012 transfer student to the UO 

from the Pratt Institute in New York City. At Pratt I was majoring in Architecture, and minoring 

in Painting/Drawing and Critical/Visual Studies. After working closely with a theoretical nuclear 

physicist, I decided to pursue an education in Physics.</p>

<p>I became a part of SPS in FA2012 and Brian/Jeff adopted me as an “unofficial utility officer” 

because I wanted to get more involved. Annika and I want to take SPS in a different direction - 

this time centered around activities, outreach, and student participation.</p>

<p>The niche of Physics that interests me most is Astrophysics. Specifically black holes and their 

influence on galactic structure. Ultimately, I want to end up in Science Communication.</p>

<br />
      <p><strong>Zach Rowland: General Manager</strong></p>

   <p>Senior</p>

<p>I went to COCC for two years before realizing that I wanted to pursue a science field instead 

of criminal justice. I love learning about how systems work and interact with each other. The 

more you learn about how the world works around you the more you can appreciate and enjoy 

it. I ultimately want to take what I learn from UofO and apply it to finding more convenient and 

environmentally friendly methods of disposing of waste and utilizing renewable energy. 

I’m more of a hands-on physicist as opposed to a critical analyzer, which is important in any 

science field, but that’s just how I work. </p>

<p>I’ve done research with thermoelectric and magnetic materials, but this year I want to focus 

on designing and analyzing experiments. My nickname is hackysackzach, and yes I’m that 

crazy person you’ll always see playing out on campus. But feel free to join if you want, because 

nothing is more fun than advancing your motor skills while talking about the world of science!</p>  

<br />
        <p><strong>Zachary Derocher: Vice-President</strong></p>
        <p>Senior</p>

        <p>I'm in my 4th year at the University of Oregon, and it feels strange to almost be done. I'm still not exactly sure what my plan is for next year; I really want to travel, so my ideal situation would be to land an internship abroad, so that I can expand my perspective while gaining experience for my future.</p>
        <p>I originally got into physics because of my interest in astronomy. I've also just always liked math and physics courses, so I thought it would be a good fit, and declared my studies Freshman year. Three years later, and I am almost done with my Major in physics and Minor in math, and I haven't second guessed my choice at all.</p>
        <p>Aside from physics, I enjoy board sports. Skateboarding and snowboarding, in particular. And, applying knowledge of physics to these sports only makes them more fun!</p>
        <br />
		<p><strong>William McNichols: Secretary</strong></p>
		<p>Senior</p>

		<p>As a second year physics (and soon to be math) major, I want to become as involved in the 

physics department as I possibly can. So when this position was offered to me quite suddenly 

at the start of fall term, I accepted gratefully and am ready to do what it takes to make this year 

a highly successful one for the SPS. I am highly interested in both astro and geophysics and I 

plan to dabble in each before I graduate in the next two or three years.</p>
		
		<p>Ultimately, I want to find myself working in a research facility, studying the esoteric, or possibly 

go into teaching. I haven’t hashed out all the details yet, but I’ve got time to figure it out. And 

the U of O physics department is a great place to do all the figuring with its abundant research 

opportunities and awesome professors. The path you take here could lead to the door that puts 

you on the fast track to an awesome career at the U of O and beyond.The SPS is prepared and 

eager to facilitate this process and I look forward to the new year.</p>

		<p><strong>Justin Stockwell: Treasurer</strong></p>
		<p>Senior</p>

        <p>I am currently in my fourth year of schooling and second as a Physics and Math dual major here at the UofO.  I attended OIT studying Renewable Energy Engineering for two years before a fantastic physics professor convinced me to change course.  My main interest, like a surprising number of the other officers, is astrophysics.  In particular Dark Matter and Dark Energy.  I’d like to work for a research institute studying these strange, yet vital facets of our Universe.  I am also interested in perhaps teaching down the road, and have served as an undergraduate SLP co-teaching scholar for an astronomy course last spring.</p>
        <p>I got involved with SPS as a minor character last fall.  SPS helped open me up to the wide array of possibilities here at the university, and I was thankful for that opportunity.  As a new physics student it is so vital to immerse yourself in all that UofO has to offer, and this club helps with that.  I became an officer because I recognized the importance of this immersion and want to help others do the same.</p>
